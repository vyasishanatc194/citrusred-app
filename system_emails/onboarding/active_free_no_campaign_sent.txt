 
Dear [FIRSTNAME_OR_USERNAME],
 
Hope you are doing well :) 

Hooray...I noticed that you signed up to RedCappi Email Marketing and I wanted to check in to see if you needed any help or had any questions on getting started with your email marketing. 

I encourage you to try our DIY email editor to see just how easy it is to create an email or a newsletter with RedCappi. Our goal with RedCappi is to provide simplicity that you can "really feel". 

If you need help or have any questions, we can also setup a phone appointment or even a demo if you'd like :) 

Alternatively, you can check out our quick tutorial here:
