Hi [USERNAME],

We tried to bill you for your RedCappi account, but your credit card on file failed and your payment was declined.

RedCappi services will temporarily be disabled until payment is received.

How do I fix this?

	- To reactivate your account, log in and update your billing information and make payment.
	- If you are still having problems making payment, please consider entering a different credit card or contacting us to resolve this issue.

Need more help or have questions? Just respond to this email and we'll get it sorted!

Mahalo,
The RedCappi Team
