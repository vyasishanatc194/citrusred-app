Hello [FIRSTNAME_OR_USERNAME],

Because of this growth we would like to take a few minutes to learn more about your overall business and contact collection methods. This will be done to help you maintain a great mailing reputation and ensure your emails get into your customer's inbox, not their junk folders.

In order to approve these new contacts (and activate sending on your account again), will need answers to the following questions:

1) How were these new contacts obtained and where have they signed up to your email list? 
2) Do you have a web-log (with IP, date, etc.)? (Please attach and send back)
3) Have you emailed this list before, or is this the first time? If yes, what email provider have you emailed them from?
4) Lastly, please "agree" that you have permission to email these contacts.

Thanks in advance for your reply.

Cheers,
The RedCappi Team
